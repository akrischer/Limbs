### UPDATE 10/17/2014

Limbs is a mobile game I programmed and developed in Unity as a team of 5 during MassDiGI's Summer Innovation Program, 2014.
Currently I am working on getting some of the code up that I worked on; I don't own all of the rights.

Here is a link to the project details, however:
